# üôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hi, I‚Äôm Nantha Gabriel.

I spent several decades in the film industry, perfecting my craft as an actor, working on indie projects to Netflix features. I dropped out of school at 13 but I've never stopped learning. Now at 43, I‚Äôm embracing a new challenge and transitioning into the world of Data Science. I'm diving deep into Python, Machine Learning, AI and more.

My journey is all about growth, resilience and transformation. As I learn and build new skills, I‚Äôm passionate about using data to tell compelling stories, just like I did in film. This repository documents my progress as I work toward landing an entry-level position in Data Science. 

The people around me say it‚Äôs a long shot, but hey, I‚Äôm the one taking aim and if there‚Äôs one thing the film industry taught me, it‚Äôs perseverance.

Check out my [learning-projects](https://github.com/nanthagabriel/learning-projects/tree/learning_projects) here, from Python basics to AI foundations and my ultimate goal of becoming a Data Storyteller.

### üé¨ Fun Fact!

Before I embarked on my learning journey, I spent years acting in films, including Netflix features and gaining recognition at film festivals. The skills I developed in storytelling and problem-solving as an actor, along with the resilience I've built from countless audition rejections, are now shaping how I approach data science. Let‚Äôs just say, I‚Äôm bringing a creative, narrative-driven mindset to everything I plan to build and analyze.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub! 
I‚Äôm excited for what‚Äôs ahead. 
I hope to get to learn from you and grow together.
