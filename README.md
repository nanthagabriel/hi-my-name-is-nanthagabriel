# YEAR 2025

üôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hello! My name is Nantha Gabriel, an aspiring Data Scientist transitioning from a career in acting, with movies featured on Netflix. After leaving school at 13,  I've spent years honing my craft in film. Now, at 43, i'm diving into Data Science to pursue a new and exciting career.

This GitHub repository tracks my journey as I self-teach Python, Machine Learning, AI, and more. Each project here represents a milestone in my learning as I build a solid foundation in tech and work toward a career in data science.

ü§ñ Current Focus Areas
- Python Programming: Learning the fundamentals and applying them in real-world projects.
- Machine Learning: Diving into algorithms and hands-on projects using Python libraries like scikit-learn and pandas.
- Data Analysis & Visualization: Analyzing datasets and visualizing insights with libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn.
- AI Foundations: Learning about decision trees, search algorithms, and problem-solving techniques in AI.
- Algorithms & Data Structures: Strengthening my problem-solving skills with a focus on sorting, searching and efficient coding practices.
