# YEAR 2025

üôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hi, my name is Nantha Gabriel. I‚Äôm an aspiring Data Scientist making a career transition from acting. I dropped out of school at 13 and spent the next several decades perfecting my craft in film, starting with indie projects and eventually working on Netflix films. Now at 43 and in the pursuit of change, I‚Äôm pivoting from the film industry into tech. The people around me say its a long shot but hey, i'm the one taking aim and If theres one thing the film industry has taught me, that'll be perseverance. 

This repository documents my journey of discovery and transformation, as I learn Python, Machine Learning, AI and beyond. Each project I complete helps me craft a new chapter in my story of becoming a Data Storyteller. Each month represents a milestone in my learning as I build a foundation and work toward a career in the field of Data Science. You can follow my progress here and explore my projects in my [learning-projects](https://github.com/nanthagabriel/learning-projects/tree/learning_projects) repository.

üé¨ Fun Fact!
- Before i embarked on my learning journey, I spent years acting in films, including Netflix features and recognition at film festivals. The skills I developed in storytelling and problem solving as an actor, along with the resilience i've developed from countless audition rejections, are now shaping how I approach data science. Let‚Äôs just say, I‚Äôm bringing a creative and narrative driven mindset to everything I plan to build and analyze.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub! 
I‚Äôm excited for what‚Äôs ahead. 
I hope to get to learn from you and grow together.
