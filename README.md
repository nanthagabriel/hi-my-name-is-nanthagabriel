# YEAR 2025

üôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hi, I‚Äôm Nantha Gabriel! I‚Äôm an aspiring Data Scientist making a career transition from acting. I left school at 13 and spent the next several years perfecting my craft in film, starting with indie projects and eventually working on Netflix films. Now, at 43, I‚Äôm excited to pivot into the world of Data Science and apply the problem-solving and storytelling skills I‚Äôve developed throughout my career to this new and dynamic field.

This GitHub repository tracks my journey as I self-teach Python, Machine Learning, AI, and more. Each project here represents a milestone in my learning as I build a foundation in tech and work toward a career in data science.

ü§ñ Current Focus Areas
- Python Programming: Learning the fundamentals and applying them in real-world projects.
- Machine Learning: Diving into algorithms and hands-on projects using Python libraries like scikit-learn and pandas.
- Data Analysis & Visualization: Analyzing datasets and visualizing insights with libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn.
- AI Foundations: Learning about decision trees, search algorithms, and problem-solving techniques in AI.
- Algorithms & Data Structures: Strengthening my problem-solving skills with a focus on sorting, searching and efficient coding practices.

üé¨ Fun Fact!
Before diving into Data Science, I spent years acting in films, including several featured on Netflix and earning recognition at film festivals. The skills I developed in storytelling and problem solving as an actor are now shaping how I approach data science. Let‚Äôs just say, I‚Äôm bringing a creative and narrative driven mindset to everything I plan to build and analyze.
